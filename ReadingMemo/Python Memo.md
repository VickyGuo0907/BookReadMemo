### 1. What's the Python interpreter?

    The Python interpreter is a program that 
    runs the Python programs you write.
    
### 2. What is source code?
	Source code is the statements you write for your 
	program -- it consists of text in text files that 
	normally end with a .py extension.
	

### 3. What is byte code?
	Byte code is the lower-level form of your program
	after Python compiles it. Python automatically
	stores byte code in files with a .pyc extension.
	
### 4. What is the PVM?
	The PVM is the Python Virtual Machine-- the 	runtime engine of Python that interprets your 	compiled byte code
	
### 5. Name two or more variations on Python's standard execution model
	Psyco,Shed Skin, and frozen binaries are all
	variations on the execution model. In addition,
	the alternative implementations of Python named in 
	the next two answers modify the model in some
	fashion as well--by replacing byte code and VMs,
	or by adding tools and JITs.
	
	
### 6. How are CPython, Jython,and IronPython different?
	CPython is the standard implementation of the
	language.Jython and IronPython implement Python
	programs for use in Java and .NET enviroments,
	respectively; they are alternative compilers for
	Python.
	
### 7. What are Stackless and PyPy?
	Stackless is an enhanced version of Python aimed 
	at concurrency, and PyPy is a reimplementation of 
	Python targeted at speed. PyPy is also the 
	successor to Psyco, and incorporates the JIT
	concepts that Psyco pioneered.
